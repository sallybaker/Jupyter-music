# World War I Music Scores

This is my first Jupyter notebook. It was a project put together during the [Hacking Heritage: the GLAM Workbench](https://www.canberra.edu.au/artsdesign/shortcourses/hacking-heritage) three day intensive workshop with [Tim Sherratt](https://timsherratt.org/). 

The notebook queries the *World War I Music Scores* dataset provided by the State Library of Queensland and performs some very simple data manipulation and analysis. 

Data for this notebook is available on the [Queensland Government Open Data Portal](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/state-library-of-queensland-music-queensland-world-war-1).
